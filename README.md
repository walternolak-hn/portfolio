- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walternolak-hn (Walter Nolasco). Computer Science Engineer since 2012. Previous developer for Windows Applications at my beginnings. I've been working in Software Quality Assurance area for about 5 years now. I have a solid/strong knowledge regarding manual testing (Test cases, QA management tools, Functional/Non-functional testing) as well as Automation testing in JS tools (WebdriverIO, Selenium webdriver, Appium, Cypress, Postman). Also familiarized with Agile / Scrum methodologies working for important US projects on the last companies I've had worked for
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in continue learning about automation testing and best practices for manual testing in order to reduce tests execution times and deliver software more fast always keeping quality at its best. Also I'm always open to hear about new opportunities that will help my professional profile to continue growing and keep updated for the new tendencies and tools for both manual and automation testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Automation testing based on JS tools (Cypress, Artillery for load testing, CI/CD integrations). Already having a solid foundation and knowledge using WebdriverIO for both web and mobile apps using Selenium and Appium libraries to build test scripts and running tests locally or in cloud based platforms such as Browserstack / Sauce Labs
