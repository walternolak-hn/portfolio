- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @walternolak-hn (Walter Nolasco). Computer Science Engineer since 2012. Previous developer for Windows Applications at my beginnings.
- I've been working in Software Quality Assurance area for about 9 years now.
- I have a solid/strong knowledge of manual testing (Test cases, test plans, QA management tools, Functional/Non-functional testing) as well as Automation testing in JS tools (WebdriverIO, Selenium webdriver, Appium, Playwright, Postman). Also, familiarized myself with Agile / Scrum methodologies working for important US projects on the last companies I've worked for.
- Testing types I've done and executed throughout these years: Smoke testing, Regression testing, Integration testing, Compatibility testing, UAT testing, API testing, Load testing, E2E testing, Automation testing (Web, Mobile and API), Usability testing, UI/UX testing.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about automation testing and best practices for manual testing to reduce tests execution times and deliver software faster always keeping quality at its best. Also, I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities that will help my professional profile to continue growing and keep updated on the new testing tendencies and tools for both manual and automation testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Automation testing based on JS tools (Cypress, Artillery for load testing, CI/CD integrations). Already having a solid foundation and knowledge using WebdriverIO for both web and mobile apps using Selenium and Appium libraries to build test scripts and running tests locally or in cloud-based platforms such as Browserstack / Sauce Labs
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [This](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-nolasco-4a3b9234/) is my LinkedIn profile if you want to give it a look at my work experience throughout these years and my email is: walternolak@gmail.com
- Also you can find in this repo a sample of web automation testing using WebdriverIO under the wdio-internet-app branch.
- I'll keep adding more samples of automation testing using other test frameworks.
